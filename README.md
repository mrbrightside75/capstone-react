## Features

-   User role management (Clerical, Supervisor, Service Coordinator, Medical Records, Admin)
-   Dynamic case management with status updates (Referral, Awaiting Validation, Assigned, etc.)
-   Generate and store referral letters as PDFs
-   Admin dashboard with role-based views

## Workflow Steps

### Log In

-   Navigate to the login page.
-   Enter your username and password (or simply press **Login** for demo purposes).
-   After logging in, you will be redirected to the **Dashboard**.

### Check Dashboard for Existing Cases

-   On the Dashboard, review the list of existing cases.
-   Ensure the case you are about to create is not already listed. You can search by name or DOB.
-   If the case already exists, follow the appropriate steps to manage it based on its status. If not, proceed to the next step.

### Create a New Case

-   Navigate to the **New Case** page (accessible via the navigation bar).
-   Fill out the required demographic information for the new child, such as:
    -   First Name
    -   Last Name
    -   Date of Birth
    -   Address
    -   Race, Ethnicity, Language, etc.
-   Once the form is completed, click **Add Child** to submit the new case.
-   The new case should now appear on the Dashboard.

### Generate a New Referral

-   After the case is created, click **View** (on the Dashboard page).
-   In the case navbar (left side), select **Add New Referral**.
-   Fill out the necessary referral information, including any notes or additional details.
-   Submit the referral.

### Validate the Case (Supervisor)

-   Navigate to the **Inbox** to see cases that are in the "Awaiting Validation" status.
-   Log in as a Supervisor or switch to the **Supervisor** role from the role selector.
-   For each case, click the **View** button to review the details.
-   If everything is correct, validate the referral. This will change the case status to "Validated" and your role will be reset to "Clerical."

### Assign Service Coordinator (Supervisor)

-   Log in as a Supervisor or switch to the **Supervisor** role from the role selector.
-   Once the referral is validated, assign a Service Coordinator to the case.
-   From the **Inbox**, find the "Validated" cases and click the **Assign** button for the relevant case.
-   Select a Service Coordinator from the dropdown menu and confirm the assignment.
-   The case status will update to "Assigned."

### Accept the Case (Service Coordinator)

-   Navigate to the **Inbox**, where youâ€™ll find cases that are assigned to the **Service Coordinator** role.
-   Log in as a Service Coordinator or switch to the **Service Coordinator** role.
-   For each case, click the **Accept** button to confirm acceptance of the case.
-   This action updates the case status to "Active," and you can now proceed with Early Intervention services.
